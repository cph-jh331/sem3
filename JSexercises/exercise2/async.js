    Asynchronous Callbacks
    Most of the javascript callbacks you will be using, will be asynchronous, 
    in contrary to map, filter and forEach which are synchronous (MAKE SURE

    1) Given the code below answer, donâ€™t execute the code, in what order

*/

var msgPrinter = function (msg, delay) {
    setTimeout(function () {
        console.log(msg);
    }, delay);
};

console.log("aaaaaaaaaa");//1
msgPrinter("bbbbbbbbbb", 2000);//5 2000 = 2sec.
console.log("dddddddddd");//2
msgPrinter("eeeeeeeeee", 1000);//4 1000 = 1sec.
console.log("ffffffffff");//3
